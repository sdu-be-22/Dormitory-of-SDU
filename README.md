## WHAT PROBLEMS DOES OUR WEBSITE SOLVE?
We all know that after booking places in dormitories, there are inconsistencies. 
That is, the students who have booked do not come, and the seats remain reserved. 
We have solved this issue, and therefore both the user and the administrator 
can delete the reserved room.
